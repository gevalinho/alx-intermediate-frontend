This is the most common and cross-platform approach.

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the following command to install Sass globally:

npm install -g sass


Verify the installation by checking the version:

sass --version


This method installs the Dart Sass implementation, which is the primary and actively maintained version.
